	Once again, I personally believe we have designed and created a beautifully presented, informative, clean and very 
professional website and PDF document. I am extremely proud of the results we have achieved as a group of green IT students. 
In comparison with our efforts from the previous project, while the groups last project was top class from top to bottom, I 
believe we have improved on our html programming and our information acquisition skills to produce a visually stunning, clean 
and easy to navigate website and have also produced some high quality work regarding the description of our project of choice. 
While our previous project was well planned and presented, there were still aspects of our team work skills that needed to be 
worked on. These were primarily our time management and group communications skills. After completing the last assignment, we 
discussed and agreed to begin work as early as possible for this assignment. This time around, we jumped straight into the 
massive project description section of the assignment choosing our desired roles and workloads almost instantly. This created 
a great foundation on which we began building our document. While our time management and communications were not perfect and 
truly never will be, the early start and early progress allowed large amounts of downtime, real world work obligations and 
personal down time for life outside our studies. While this has had a profound and positive impact on our ability to create 
quality work within our desired timeframes, our time management can always be better and our group discussions can always be 
more frequent. In an industry where those two skills are paramount and of the utmost importance, learning that there is no 
such thing as perfect time management and perfect communications is a vital and important lesson. Even still, I was personally 
surprised by how much quality work we were able to achieve, while also correctly and wisely managing our time for work on our 
other projects for our IT course.

	Very happy with our little group. As I was the first time around but we worked better together this time. We learnt from 
our first group task what needed to be worked on and we adapted and fixed it for this task. The Gantt chart was really helpful 
keeping us on task in the timeframe we had. Discord of course was our most helpful tool in communication, as we could see what 
everyone was doing and how things were progressing. I learnt that no matter how different people are they can work together with 
communication and kind motivation from the leader which happens to be Rob in our case. I’m grateful to all the members of our 
group for doing a good job. I’m afraid they set such a high standard for groups in my mind that if i’m put in another group down 
the track that it won’t stack up to this one! As far as the GitHub log activity, I believe it’s pretty accurate, as it shows the 
fact that Rob brought over information from the last Assignment, as well as the information we all added into our agreed sections 
and edits that we have each made. However most of our editing goes into a word document before pasted into GitHub so there may 
be more edits than shown by each individual but overall I still believe it’s good.
