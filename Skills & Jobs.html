<p style="font-size: 20px">After hearing from a group of venture capitalists and their wishes to fund the development for a further 
6 months, our team will act as a board of video game creative directors responsible for overseeing and guiding a soon to be newly 
employed group of video game development professionals.</p>
	<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Video Game Creative Directors:</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Creative Directors are responsible for maintaining the original creative vision and direction 
of the video game and directing the team to that vision. Characters, storylines and unique and original concepts are all 
key aspects of the original vision. A creative director is also responsible for mentoring, unifying and inspiring the team 
to meet deadlines and to follow their own creative direction. Some of the most highly regarded skills involved with being 
a creative director is human resource management, time scheduling and finance or budgeting skills. Video game creative directors usually 
have a bachelors degree in game design, game art and/or game development. These qualifications are usually the minimum 
requirements and a video game creative director will have further training and qualifications added to their bachelor's degree in 
order be seen as a worthy and valuable video game director.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Lead Artist:</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">A lead artist's role involves creating an innovating and original art style and are the lead artist's 
key responsibilities. They create 2D or 3D art for the game involving the design of the characters, enemies, bosses, background 
and other miscellaneous textures. Their skills all revolve around a creative and unique style and their ability to use the required 
software to create the necessary work. They also must be able to follow the direction and vision given to them by the lead 
developer or director and help portray the creative director's vision to the lead level designer and lead programmer via sketches 
and drawings. Communication skills are absolutely vital for explaining their work and reasonings for their particular chosen art 
style. While qualifications are not necessary with artistic roles, a bachelors degree in graphic design adds a tremendous amount 
of muscle to an artist's resume.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Lead Programmer:</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Lead programmers are responsible for turning the director's or designers' vision into a viable and 
working product. Gathering all of the necessary communicative directions, graphs, images and tools together the lead programmer 
must be proficient in using C# or C++ and a number of API's or application programming interfaces to generate a working product 
in accordance with the creative director or lead designers' vision. They work hand in hand with the level designer and in small 
companies the testers as well so good communications skills are a must in addition to programming skills. Qualifications for this 
role include a bachelor's degree in software design, software engineering and computer science.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Lead Level Designer:</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">A level designer is responsible for the creative development of the pathways and puzzles in the video game 
levels. A level designer also requires skill and experience in using level editing software to create level environments consisting of 
NPC pathing and responses, player and enemy spawn points, hidden pathways and in general all the textures, sounds, animations and atmosphere. 
There are a number of key design principles for level designers to follow. Such principles include guiding the player through levels without 
appearing to be holding their hand, continually increasing difficulty for level progression for a rewarding gaming experience for the 
player and generally making the level make sense and have purpose. Like the programmers the level designers need to have good communication 
skills for working with other members of the development team such as the artists, testers and programmers. Qualifications for this role 
include a bachelor's degree in software design, software engineering, video game design and computer science.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Video Game Tester:</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Video game testers provide a supportive role for designers and developers and are responsible for playing the 
current build of the game, looking for bugs, defects and game breaking situations that can appear with an incomplete video game. Once bugs 
are found testers must try to continually reproduce the same bugs for the development team so the team can identify the errors causing the 
bugs and then begin work on fixing them. Due to potential meetings with the development team, testers must have sound communicative abilities, 
while superb communications skills are not necessary, testers must be able to professionally explain to the development team the what and 
how of the problem. After providing a bug report and the development team has identified and fixed the problem/s, the tester must then try 
and reproduce the same bug or exploit to make sure it has been fixed completely. No qualifications are necessary for a role such as video game 
testing as it is usually performed by undergraduate university students still completing their video game design, computer science or software 
engineering bachelor's degrees.
