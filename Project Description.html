	<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Aims</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
	Our team has a small number of goals during the development of this project and each one of these goals will 
directly correspond to completing our main aim of achieving a professionally built, working and bug-free 2D side-scrolling 
platform game within the 15-week time period. As a group of green yet excited programmers, we aim to work as a team to 
perfect our programming skills, communications skills and understanding of all the tools associated with the development 
of a video game.<br><br>

One of our team's primary goals is to successfully build a game with a minimum of two working levels and a working boss 
battle level. This could have been extended to much more than just three levels in total however the limitations of the 
project would not allow the development of any extra content such as this. Keeping the goal as simple as possible is vital 
in ensuring a professionally and competent product is successfully completed within the strict constraints of the 
project.<br><br>

Another important goal that our team will need to accomplish in order to successfully complete this project is to continue 
to gain and improve our programming skills that we've learnt so far during our time in this IT course. While we have been 
studying Introduction to Information Technology, our team has also been studying Introduction to Programming, which has 
taught us invaluable or priceless programming skills and techniques. While we have only been learning the Java language, 
the team has learned crucial core programming concepts and fundamentals that are used across all programming languages. 
Continued study and understanding of the Java language and the learning of a new language in C# for the required code in 
the Unity game development program will allow our team to achieve our main aim of the project.<br><br>

A similar goal to the one above is continue to gain and improve our ability to master the use of programming, design and 
communication tools and technologies associated with the construction of a video game. While learning the programming 
languages Java and C# are crucial, the understanding and skills relating to the tools used in creating and developing the 
code are just as vital. Our team will have to learn and master the Unity 2D engine in order to complete the development of 
the video game and continue to use other required communication tools such as Discord to share ideas, constructive criticism, 
timeframes and completion checklists.<br><br>

Finally, our group's last but most important goal is to work as a team during the life of the video game's development. 
Numerous processes will be put into place such as communicative tools and timeframe utilities such as Gantt charts and 
completion checklists in order to effectively make use of our team's unique and dynamic skillsets. Making full use of 
converting these individual skills into a hive-like-mind will greatly increase our ability to complete a well-polished 
and engaging video game within the allotted timeframe.<br>

	I am some text.
	</p>
	<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Roles</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		Firstly our team will have a roadmap of what needs to be done. As our team is small our roles may change 
depending on what is in store for us that week. Our team is also versitile and can help improve different parts of the game 
however some roles can be implemented such as a Client Programmer/Developer, Designer & Artist. Whoever is stronger in C++ or C#
& Unity would be under the role Lead Programmer/Developer, others who can help in this section would follow under the Lead as just
a developer.<br><br>

The Designer and Artist would work together to create the levels needed and environment in each level.
Nothing needs to be set in stone for our team as we can all work on certain aspects, we believe that communication during 
all parts is the key to the success in the development of the game.<br>
	
	  </p>
	<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Scope & Limits</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
	With the planning of any major project, defining the scope and its limitations is one of the most important tasks 
involved in the process. This game development project is no different and will detail its deliverables and also its 
limitations. Following this well-defined scope with the utmost accuracy will ensure our group delivers a timely and 
professional product.<br><br>

Firstly, the game will be developed through the Unity game development program to produce a 2-dimensional side scrolling 
platform game and will contain 2 levels and a boss level for a total of 3 levels. The game will have some 8-bit music 
reminiscent of the old-school era of computer games and will give the user control of a playable character or hero that 
can navigate the 3 levels. The character will be required to move through these levels using very basic movement commands 
such as jumping and moving from left to right. These first 2 levels will contain obstacles for the character to avoid, 
manoeuvre around and jump over such as changing ground, dangerous objects or areas such as deadly spikes or empty spaces 
representing bottomless pits. The character will also be required to fight monsters or enemies and if the character moves 
within a certain range of the enemies they will move towards the character and attack them, requiring the user to either 
evade the enemy or attack them first.<br><br>

To be true to the hardcore nature of the older video games the character or hero will not have a hp bar so if the character 
is hit by the enemy the character will instantly die, lose one of the 3 allocated lives and then respawn on the side of the 
screen, being immune for 10 seconds. If the character dies 3 times then it will be game over and the player will have to 
start the game from the beginning. Once the user navigates the character through the first 2 levels of the game, they will 
arrive at the final level: the boss battle. The boss will be a large monster or creature and will use a ranged attack that 
the hero will be required to avoid. While dodging and evading the bosses ranged attacks the user will have small time 
window to move closer and land a killing blow. Once the boss has been defeated the game will end congratulating the player 
for beating the game, displaying the credits and then asking if the player would like to play again.<br><br>

There are also a number of limitations that have played significant factors in defining the scope of the project. These 
limitations can be primarily summed up into 2 categories, time and skill. The time limits of this project are especially 
tight as we have only been given 15 weeks to complete the project. This means that the project has been drastically limited 
in terms of game size, scale and artist detail. The other major limitation is our groups programming skill and game 
development knowledge and the lack of that such skill also plays a crucial role in determining the depth of the game and 
amount of overall content in the game.<br><br>

Due to the limits mentioned above the developed game will not include some features that would normally be included in video 
games such as this one. Multiple characters, additional lengthy levels and boss fights, key items, puzzles and an engaging 
story line have all been removed from the project plan to enable a quick and time friendly project. Obviously good graphical 
detail, advanced character controls and advanced enemy attack patterns will not be included either for the very same reasons. 
Using these constraints as a platform from which to develop the game, our group will be able to deliver a professionally competent 
project within the specified timeframe.<br>
	</p>
	<h2 style="font-size: 100px; color: orange">Tools & Technologies</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
	Our team will need need to have certain programs to be able to develop our project and our computers/laptops will need to 
have the hardware to successfully run these programs without fail.<br>
		
One of the programs used would be Unity, as long as we aren't making more than $100k in annual gross revenues we can get Unity for 
free. It however doesn't come with support and training. Unity allows us to create an environment in which each level takes place 
as well as create our sprites.  If our team wanted to use something out of Unity we could get GIMP to create assests which would be 
then imported into Unity.<br>
		
For C++ aspect of our game we will get a C++ IDE (integrated development environment) of our choosing, we can use Eclipse, Code::Blocks
or Visual Studio. <br>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">
	Throughout the semester our project team has been in contact with each other using a number of communication methods. 
The quantity and quality of the communications have been consistent and professional at all times. While there have been some 
quiet periods such as a few days to a week long period straight after handing in a previous assignment or project, our team 
completely understands and appreciates the ongoing and changing lifestyles and workloads that we all have. On average our team 
has been in regular conversation more than 3-4 times a week using communication methods and technologies or tools such as RMIT 
Canvas, Discord, Email and even through mobile phone communications and will continue to do so during the completion of the 
remainder of our team's projects. Our team's aim is to continue these communicative practices for the remainder of the semester 
until all the remaining projects have been completed with the utmost professionalism and competency. While frustrations do arise 
from team members going missing from time to time due to unforeseen reasons, it has been and will continue to be only for a small 
day to two-day period. In order to counter these unforeseen problems and similar problems that occurred during our team's last 
project, we have all agreed to organise ourselves better for this project and start working on the project at our earliest 
conveniences. This will drastically reduce the amount of anxieties and frustrations known to accompany missing team members and 
contribute greatly to completing and handing in a polished and professional report.<br>
