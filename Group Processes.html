	While our team was able to construct a PDF document and webpage for assignment 2 with the highest quality 
possible, there were definitely times when the team could have been working together more efficiently and effectively. 
The biggest hinderance to our completion of the very large workload set before us was quite simply our enthusiasm in 
starting the project within a reasonable time. While some members were quick to begin construction of the PDF and the 
group webpage, others left their work until the very last minutes, causing high stress, anxiety and frustration to the 
rest of the group. In order to counter these teamwork problems during work on the last assignment, some members took 
it upon themselves to do more than their fair share of the work just so that the project would be completed on time 
and with high quality. After writing our team reflection and SparkPLUS critiques, we came together as a group to 
organise some more effective ways of producing our projects in the future.<br><br>

After having constructive conversations with the team upon project submission we were all in agreement that there 
should be some changes for the next few team projects. One of these changes was the continuation of a team leader 
for the projects, however this time they would be operating as the team leader from the origin of the project. This 
would prove to greatly increase our team's efficiency and effectiveness across the lifespans of the remaining group 
projects. Another highly important change we all agreed to make was to choose our workloads and begin working on 
these workloads at our earliest conveniences. Beginning our development of our PDF and webpage as early as possible 
would be crucial in the later weeks of the session as multiple projects and assignments were now due across multiple 
subjects and the only way to properly deal with the large quantities of work required was by starting early on as 
many necessary projects as possible. Being time efficient from the beginning would ensure that our workloads would 
not get out of control and push unnecessary stresses and strains onto the other group members.<br><br>

Lastly, one other extremely important factor in building and maintaining great team work is great team communication. 
Thankfully our group has been in contact with one another since the group's inception and have continued to be productive 
in regards to team communications. This ongoing communicative effectiveness will continue to enable our team to resolve 
almost all potential work-related issues in the future before they become large and stressful problems.<br>
